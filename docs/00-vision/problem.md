# Problem Statement

## Purpose
Define the core problem StudySharper solves and validate market opportunity.

## The Problem
Students spend 60%+ of study time on ineffective methods (re-reading, highlighting, cramming) while research-proven techniques (spaced repetition, active recall, interleaving) remain unused due to complexity and lack of integration.

### Pain Points
1. **Fragmented Tools**: Notes in Google Docs, calendar in phone, flashcards in Anki, assignments in LMS
2. **No Intelligence**: Tools don't adapt to forgetting curves, cognitive load, or schedule constraints  
3. **Manual Planning**: Students guess at study schedules, ignore optimal spacing intervals
4. **Isolation**: No feedback loop between study methods and actual performance
5. **Overwhelming Choice**: 100+ study apps with no clear winner or integration

### Current Alternatives & Gaps
- **Anki**: Powerful SRS but steep learning curve, no calendar integration
- **Notion**: Great for notes but no spaced repetition or study planning
- **Google Calendar**: Good for scheduling but no study science integration
- **Khan Academy**: Excellent content but limited to their curriculum
- **Coursera/edX**: Course-specific, no cross-course study planning

### Jobs to Be Done
**Primary Job**: "Help me study more effectively with less time and stress"

**Subsidiary Jobs**:
- "Organize all my academic information in one place"
- "Tell me what to study when based on science"
- "Help me remember what I learned long-term"
- "Keep me on track with deadlines and goals"
- "Show me if my study methods are working"

## Target Market
**Primary**: US college students (21M), especially STEM majors
**Secondary**: High school AP students (2.8M), working professionals learning new skills

## Success Metrics
- 40% improvement in long-term retention vs. control group
