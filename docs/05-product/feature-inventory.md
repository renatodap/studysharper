## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All MUST HAVE features implemented and tested
- [ ] Feature flags allow gradual rollout
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for core user journeys
- [ ] Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) compliance
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness across devices
- [ ] Error handling and graceful degradation

## Risks
- **AI Provider Rate Limits**: Mitigate with local fallback, usage monitoring
- **Feature Scope Creep**: Strict MoSCoW adherence, user feedback validation
- **Technical Complexity**: Start simple, iterate based on user needs
- **User Adoption**: Focus on clear value props, minimize onboarding friction

## Open Questions
- Should flashcard review be separate app section or integrated into study plans?
- How granular should study method recommendations be (course vs topic level)?
- What level of calendar integration is needed for MVP success?

## Done means...
Complete feature roadmap with clear priorities, success metrics, and implementation phases that guide all development decisions and resource allocation.
