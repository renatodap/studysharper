- ‚úÖ Created database schema
- ‚úÖ Implemented all features
- ‚úÖ Verified code compiles and builds
- ‚úÖ Created deployment scripts

**What I HAVEN'T Done:**
- ‚ùå Set up actual Supabase project
- ‚ùå Tested with real users
- ‚ùå Connected real payment system
- ‚ùå Deployed to live server

**Your Job:** Connect real services and deploy

## STEP 1: SET UP SUPABASE DATABASE (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Create Project
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Sign up/login with GitHub
4. Click "New project"
5. Choose organization
6. Project name: `studysharper`
7. Database password: **Write this down** (you'll need it)
8. Region: Choose closest to your users
9. Click "Create new project"
10. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for project to be ready

### 1.2 Run Database Migration
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to "SQL Editor"
2. Click "New query"
3. Open this file: `studysharper-deploy/supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`
4. **Copy ALL the contents** (it's 399 lines)
5. **Paste into Supabase SQL editor**
6. Click "Run" button
7. Should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ SUCCESS: All 14 tables created successfully!
   üìä Created tables: profiles, study_sessions, notes, flashcards, flashcard_decks, ai_conversations, study_goals, study_streaks, pomodoro_sessions, usage_tracking, referrals, achievements, team_study_rooms, team_study_members
   ```
8. Go to "Table Editor" to verify 14 tables were created

**If you see any errors:**
- The migration will automatically drop existing tables first
- This is safe to run multiple times
- All tables will be recreated with correct structure

### 1.3 Get Your Credentials
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí API
2. Copy these 3 values:
   - **Project URL**: `https://[something].supabase.co`
   - **anon public key**: `eyJ...` (long string)
   - **service_role secret key**: `eyJ...` (long string)

## STEP 2: CONFIGURE ENVIRONMENT (2 minutes)

### 2.1 Edit Environment File
1. Open `studysharper-deploy/.env.local`

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR-ANON-KEY-HERE
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR-SERVICE-ROLE-KEY-HERE
```

### 2.2 Test Database Connection
1. Open terminal in `studysharper-deploy` folder
2. Run: `node scripts/test-with-real-data.js`
3. Should see: "‚úÖ Database connection successful"
