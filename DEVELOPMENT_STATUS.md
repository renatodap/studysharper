### AI System Architecture
```
User Input → AI Router → Primary Provider (OpenRouter)
                     └─→ Fallback Provider (Ollama)
                     
Content Upload → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embeddings → Vector Store
                     
User Question → Query Embedding → Vector Search → Context Retrieval → AI Response
```

### Database Schema Highlights
- **Academic Hierarchy**: Users → Schools → Terms → Courses → Subjects
- **Content System**: Notes → Embeddings (pgvector) → RAG pipeline
- **Study System**: Plans → Blocks → Sessions with AI reasoning
- **Spaced Repetition**: Decks → Cards → Reviews with SM-2 algorithm
- **Analytics**: Events, Metrics for performance tracking

## 📚 Key Implementation Highlights

### AI Provider System
```typescript
// Automatic failover with cost tracking
const aiRouter = createAIRouter({
  primaryProvider: 'openrouter',
  fallbackProvider: 'ollama',
  dailyBudget: 5.00,
  models: {
    chat: 'anthropic/claude-3-haiku',
    embedding: 'text-embedding-3-small'
  }
})
```

### Content Processing Pipeline
```typescript
// PDF → Text → Chunks → Embeddings → RAG
const processor = new ContentProcessor()
const content = await processor.processFile({
  file: uploadedFile,
  courseId: 'course-uuid',
  extractImages: false
})
// Automatically creates searchable chunks with metadata
```

### Study Plan Generation
```typescript
// AI-powered scheduling with cognitive science
const planner = new StudyPlanner(aiProvider)
const plan = await planner.generatePlan({
  courses: userCourses,
  deadlines: upcomingDeadlines,
  preferences: userPreferences,
  planDuration: 7 // days
})
// Returns optimized schedule with reasoning
```
