## 📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### 🗄️ Set Up Database (5 minutes)
**What:** Create Supabase project and run migration  
**Why:** I built the schema, but you need a real database  
**How:** 
1. Go to supabase.com
2. Create project
3. Copy/paste migration SQL
4. Get credentials

### ⚙️ Configure Environment (2 minutes)
**What:** Add real credentials to `.env.local`  
**Why:** I created template, but you need real keys  
**How:**
1. Open `.env.local` 
2. Replace placeholder values
3. Save file

### 🧪 Test Locally (5 minutes)
**What:** Verify everything works before deploying  
**Why:** Catch issues early, ensure functionality  
**How:**
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Test signup/login
3. Create flashcards
4. Test study session

### 🚀 Deploy to Production (5 minutes)
**What:** Make app live on the internet  
**Why:** I built it, but you need to host it  
**How:**
1. Push to GitHub
2. Import to Vercel
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

### ✅ Verify Live (3 minutes)
**What:** Test live app works same as local  
**Why:** Ensure production deployment successful  
**How:**
1. Sign up on live site
2. Create flashcards
3. Test functionality
