## 2025-08-13 02:00 UTC - Session Start: Academic Structure Implementation

### Critical Path Analysis
Based on feature inventory and workplan, implementing core academic hierarchy:
1. **School Management** - Foundation for multi-institution support
2. **Term Management** - Academic calendar structure 
3. **Course Creation** - Core content organization
4. **Subject Breakdown** - Granular study organization

### High Priority Queue (Next 3 Features)
1. **School/Term/Course Management** - High user value, medium complexity, unblocks content ingestion
2. **PDF Upload & Processing** - High value, high complexity, critical for AI features
3. **Study Plan Generation** - High value, high complexity, core differentiator

### Current Implementation Plan
- Create academic structure UI components
- Implement CRUD operations with Supabase
- Add form validation and error handling
- Test complete academic setup flow
- Add visual feedback and loading states

### Performance Budget Tracking
- Dashboard load time: < 2s target
- Course creation: < 500ms target
- Navigation between sections: < 200ms target

### Next Session Priorities
1. Complete academic structure implementation
2. Begin PDF upload system
3. Create study plan generator foundation
4. Implement basic analytics tracking
